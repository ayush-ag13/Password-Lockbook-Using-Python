# Password-Lockbook
This is a password lockbook where you can store your user id information (website name and password)
and it can search for a website's password that you have stored before.

The Default password to proceed with main.py is iitropar
You can change it in Line 74 of main.py

It also includes an algorithm which will suggest you a strong automated password while saving the password.

GO AHEAD
Now you don't have to remember a bunch of passwords.

keep main.py and datasheet.txt in same folder/directory to run.
